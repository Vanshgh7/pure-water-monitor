# ðŸ’§ pure water Monitoring Dashboard

A collaborative challenge by **Omdena Kutch Chapter**
---

## Overview

This project aims to deliver an interactive dashboard that helps visualize and assess water quality in real-time, combining environmental standards, satellite data, and advanced modeling.

Throughout the process, contributors explored water quality benchmarks, collected satellite imagery, identified key water parameters, developed predictive models, and integrated the results for easy deployment.

---

## Key Parameters Tracked

- Salinity
- Chlorophyll
- Suspended Matter
- Dissolved Organic Matter
- Dissolved Oxygen
- Turbidity
- Temperature
- pH

Remote sensing data was sourced using **Google Earth Engine**.
